# A Better You

## Vision

- What is the vision of this product?

  - A Better You is an application that randomly generates wellness tasks based on the category you choose. Our vision is to create a product that helps and encourages people to build self-care rituals and implement them into their daily lives.
- What pain point does this project solve?
  - Self-care isn’t something that is heavily normalized in our society. We often get caught up in our day to day lives, and move too fast to take intentional time for ourselves. A Better You strives to help people who might need reinforcement and daily reminders to care for their physical and mental health. 
- Why should we care about your product?
  - A Better You encourages self-care through taking small steps to improve day to day well-being. It’s been proven that implementing wellness habits increases motivation and is essential in manifesting happiness.
