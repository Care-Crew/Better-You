## Conflict plan

- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
  - Plain english communication without the need for the other person to be intuitive to what you are saying. “Say exactly what you mean.” 
  - Commit to using I statements where possible. 
  - Commit to bringing forth a problem when it arises so that problems do not stew. 
  - Always have a third party present when the conflict is between two members. 
  - If things do get heated, take a 10, find some time to breathe and come back to it.
  - If a problem can not be resolved within one hour, bring in an outside party to help mediate.
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
  - Approach that person and with plain english communication, inform them that you feel like they are starting to take over the project and that you are feeling left out of the process. 
- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - Rely on each other to help cover each other's weaknesses and bolster each other's strengths. 
  - 15 minute rule for asking for help. (If another member can’t help, find a TA)
    - Be courteous and understanding of each other
    - Be understanding that not everyone has the same skill level. 
- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
  - check in with the person and see if there is anything the group can do to help. 
    - Can assign them to help pair program with another member
    - Discuss the issue they are facing and help them resolve it (see conflict resolution plan)
    - Pep talk! 
  - How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
    - If problems can’t be resolved internally within one hour of being brought to the table, then external mediation will be sought.
